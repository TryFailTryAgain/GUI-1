          <h2>FDM</h2>
          <p>
            Fused deposition modeling, or called filament freeform
            fabrication, is a 3D printing process that uses a continuous
            filament of a thermoplastic material. Filament is fed from a large
            spool through a moving, printer extruder head, and is
            deposited on the growing work. The print head is moved under
            computer control to define the printed shape. <br><br>

          <p>
            Stereolithography (SLA or SL; also known as vat
            photopolymerisation, optical fabrication, photo-solidification, or
            resin printing) is a form of 3D printing technology used for
            creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a
            layer by layer fashion using photochemical processes by which
            light causes chemical monomers and oligomers to cross-link
            together to form polymers. Those polymers then make up the body of
            a three-dimensional solid. <br><br>

          <h2>SLS</h2>
          <p>
            Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing (AM)
            technique that uses a laser as the power and heat source to sinter
            powdered material (typically nylon or polyamide), aiming the laser
            automatically at points in space defined by a 3D model, binding
            the material together to create a solid structure. It is similar
            to selective laser melting; the two are instantiations of the same
            concept but differ in technical details. SLS is a relatively new
            technology that so far has mainly been used for rapid prototyping
            and for low-volume production of component parts. <br><br>
